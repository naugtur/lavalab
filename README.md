# lavalab

Not a malware research lab.

## Usage

Requires docker present and working.  
Runs a no-network container in which malware can be gradually detonated.

- put your sample in ./samples/
- run `lab.sh`
- inside the container, run your sample: `lavalab samples/a.js`
- when in doubt, kill the container

lavalab instruments running code with proxies starting at `global` and prompts synchronously to ask what to return.
```
Return values from proxy:
 p: proxy-prompt
 l: console.log
 f: function=>proxy-prompt
 cb: function=>calls last arg
 s: a string you'll later recognize
 -: value from proxy target (eg. if you allowed to set earlier)
 U: undefined
```

### running bytecode

If you have a bytecode sample, you can run that too (as long as your node version accepts the bytecode)

Use lavalabc instead of lavalab  
`lavalabc samples/bytecode`

Behavior of asking about globals is slightly different, but the top level proxy is built on top of globalThis, so to give access to a real global, use the `-` option when asked.
That globalThis is your locked-down globalThis, so `eval` is still the safe replacement etc.

## Browser

There's a browser variant, even more barebones and experimental. See `browser/index.html`
