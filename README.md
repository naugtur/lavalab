## Usage

Requires docker present and working.  
Runs a no-network container in which malware can be gradually detonated.

- put your sample in ./samples/
- run `lab.sh`
- inside the container, run your sample: `lavalab samples/a.js`
- when in doubt, kill the container

lavalab instruments running code with proxies starting at `global` and prompts synchronously to ask what to return.
```
Return values from proxy:
 p: proxy-prompt
 n: noop function
 l: console.log
 f: function=>proxy-prompt
 s: random string
 U: undefined
```
## Browser

There's a browser variant, even more barebones and experimental. See `browser/index.html`
